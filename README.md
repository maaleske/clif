# Clif - A Clifford algebra number type for Haskell

Clif is a library for symbolic and numeric computations on Clifford algebras using Haskell. It is general enough to handle finite and infinite-dimensional Clifford algebras arising from arbitrary bilinear forms, within limitations of computability.

**Warning:** This library is not yet stable, thoroughly tested or otherwise suitable for serious work. Proceed with caution, and file issues for anything odd you find.

## How to start using it?

### From Github

    - Clone the repository
    - Run 'cabal haddock' to generate Haddock documentation
    - See the documentation for the [Tutorial](src/Clif/Tutorial.hs)
    - Run 'cabal repl' to test things out in GHCI
